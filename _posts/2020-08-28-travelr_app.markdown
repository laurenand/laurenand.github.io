In today's world traveling can be dangerous, so why not go there virtually? This app was created to help people escape from our new reality. Learn about other countries and make your plans for next year(I hope)!  

This was not my first choice for an app, I originally wanted to create something around plants. That proved to be more difficult than expected, although maybe for the next project! The name fo the app, Travelr, is a small wink to the good old blog, Tumblr. Remember writing(copying and pasting really) your code to customize your profile? Those were the days. This app is not a blog, but it does hold a lot of information.  You can fork and clone the code [here](https://github.com/laurenand/Travelr)!
